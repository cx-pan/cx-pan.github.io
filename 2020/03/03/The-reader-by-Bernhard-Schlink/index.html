            <blockquote>
<p>She had grown up in a German community in Rumania, then come to Berlin at the age of sixteen, taken a job at the Siemens factory, and ended up in the army at twenty-one. Since the end of the war, she had done all manner of jobs to get by. She had been a streetcar conductor for several years…She had no family. She was thirty-six.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: Hanna’s personal basic info. She was such an ordinary woman that nobody will notice, but when digging deeper, some shocking secrets were unvailed. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I see a woman of thirty-six today, I find her young. But when I see a boy of fifteen, I see a child.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The anesthetic functioned not only in the courtroom, and not only to allow me to see Hanna as if it was someone else who had loved and desired her, someone I knew well but who wasn’t me. In every part of my life, too, I stood outside myself and watched; I saw myself functioning at the university, with my parents and brother and sister and my friends, but inwardly I felt no involvement. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: the soul detached from the body. It seems he was living an unme life since the disapearance of Hanna. Only Hanna could brought him alive. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was like being a prisoner in the death camps who survives month after month and becomes accustomed to the life, while he registers with an objective eye the horror of the new arrivals: registers it with the same numbness that he brings to the murders and deaths themselves. All survivor literature talks about this numbness, in which life’s functions are reduced to a minimum, behavior becomes completely selfish and indifferent to others, and gassing and burning are everyday occurrences. In the rare accounts by perpetrators, too, the gas chambers and ovens become ordinary scenery, the perpetrators reduced to their few functions and exhibiting a mental paralysis and indifference, a dullness that makes them seem drugged or drunk. The defendants seemed to me to be trapped still, and forever, in this drugged state, in a sense petrified in it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: I was always confused about some people’s conduct. To murder, to kill, to slaugter, to enslave/be enslaved, all these, I was so bewildered, HOW! HOW can all these things happen? I tried hard to make sense of wars, the holacaust, ISIS etc. until I came across this book. That’s right, we are human beings, and we have humanity. However, I forgot that we are also animals, we can act like other kinds of anmimals without showing humanity. In prison, people had different roles, prisoners and perpetrators, and everybody got accustomed to it. I can never underestimate people’s strong ability to get accustomed to miserable life. For example, Trevor Noah talked about aparteit in South Africa, and white people and black people simply accepted that. At that age, everythings made sense to people at that time though now it was stupid, weird, and racist. We are human, and we are animals first. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even then, when I was preoccupied by this general numbness, and by the fact that it had taken hold not only of the perpetrators and victims, but of all of us, judges and lay members of the court, prosecutors and recorders, who had to deal with these events now; when I likened perpetrators, victims, the dead, the living, survivors, and their descendants to each other, I didn’t feel good about it and I still don’t.<br>Can one see them all as linked in this way? When I began to make such comparisons in discussions, I always emphasized that the linkage was not meant to relativize the difference between being forced into the world of the death camps and entering it voluntarily, between enduring suffering and imposing it on others, and that this difference was of the greatest, most critical importance. But I met with shock and indignation when I said this not in reaction to the others’ objections, but before they had even had the chance to demur.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We never recognize the fact that we were so numb.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What should our second generation have done, what should it do with the knowledge of the horrors of the extermination of the Jews? We should not believe we can <strong>comprehend the incomprehensible</strong>, we may <strong>not compare the incomparable</strong>, we may <strong>not inquire because to inquire is to make the horrors</strong> an object of discussion, even if the horrors themselves are not questioned, instead of accepting them as something in the face of which we can only fall silent in revulsion, shame, and guilt. Should we only fall silent in revulsion, shame, and guilt? To what purpose? It was not that I had lost my eagerness to explore and cast light on things which had filled the seminar, once the trial got under way. But that some few would be convicted and punished while we of the second generation were silenced by revulsion, shame, and guilt—was that all there was to it now?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>not driven her away did not change the fact that I had betrayed her. So I was still guilty. And if I was not guilty because one cannot be guilty of betraying a criminal, then I was guilty of having loved a criminal</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I wanted simultaneously to understand Hanna’s crime and to condemn it. But it was too terrible for that. When I tried to understand it, I had the feeling I was failing to condemn it as it must be condemned. When I condemned it as it must be condemned, there was no room for understanding. But even as I wanted to understand Hanna, failing to understand her meant betraying her all over again.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I was no longer upset at having been left, deceived, and used by Hanna. I no longer had to meddle with her. I felt the numbness with which I had followed the horrors of the trial settling over the emotions and thoughts of the past few weeks. It would be too much to say I was happy about this. But I felt it was right. It allowed me to return to and continue to live my everyday life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But what other people in my social environment had done, and their guilt, were in any case a lot less bad than what Hanna had done. I had to point at Hanna. But the finger I pointed at her turned back to me. I had loved her. Not only had I loved her, I had chosen her. I tried to tell myself that I had known nothing of what she had done when I chose her.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They were based on the belief that a good order is intrinsic to the world, and that therefore the world can be brought into good order.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Spring lets its blue banner flutter through the air again,” “Cloud shadows fly across the fields”—the poems were all full of delight in nature, and yearning for it, and the pictures showed woods bright with spring, meadows spangled with flowers, autumn foliage and single trees, a pasture by a stream, a cherry tree with ripe red cherries, an autumnal chestnut flamed in yellow and orange.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: How much Hanna is craved for nature. </p>
<p>Questions: How many people were illiterated at that time? Can this happen during WWII?<br>How do we assess Hanna’s conduct?</p>
