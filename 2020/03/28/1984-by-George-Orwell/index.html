            <p>In nearly all the dynasties, whoever ruled the country modified the history of previous and their own dynasty at their will. This is how history is generally written. For historian, the job to identify what is relatively true and vice versa is challenging. </p>
<p>When you trust a country, then you trust what the country says. When you don’t, not matter what the country says is wrong. This is how double-standards and biased are formed. Bias will always exist, and haters are gonna hate. That’s it. Don’t take it too seriously.</p>
<p>This mind-blowing masterpiece reconstructs how I understand the world and the past. It’s an imaginary nation that has many traces about the Nazis, Cultural revolution, and etc. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who controls the past, controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My thoughts: to create and rectify the past that is worse than the present, to give an illusion that the present is always getting better, also to block out the outer world to prevent people from comparing the various nations, people lack the awareness and cognition to get to know that the real past, the real present, they are unable to think. Their mind is destroyed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comrade Ogilvy, who had never existed in the present, now existed in the past, and when once the act of forgery was forgotten, he would exist just as authentically. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Orthodoxy means not thinking – not needing to think. Orthodoxy is unconsciousness. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The past was erased, the erasure was forgotten, the lie became truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They were corpse waiting to be sent back to the grave.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The past not only changed, but changed continuously.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At one time it had been a sign of madness to believe that the earth goes round the sun; today, to believe that the past is unalterable.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the end the party would announce that two and two made five, and you have to believe it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The heresy of heresies was common sense.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In principal the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Cut off from contact with the outer world, and with the past, the citizen of Oceania is like a man in interstellar space, who has no way of knowing which direction is up and which is down.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>War, it will be seen, is now purely internal affair.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But no advance in wealth, no softening of manners, no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimeter nearer. From the point of view of the Low, no historic change has ever meant much more than a change in the name of their masters.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There then rose schools of thinkers who interpreted history as a cyclical process and claimed to show that inequality was the unalterable law of human life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The keyword here is blackwhite. … Applied to an opponent, it means the habit of impudently claiming that black is white, in contradiction of the plain facts. Applied to a Party member, it means a loyal willingness to say that black is white when Party discipline demands this. But it means also the ability to believe that black is white, and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one’s mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>No one whom we bring to this place ever stands out against us. Everyone is washed clean.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Never again will you be capable of ordinary human feeling. Everything will be dead inside you. Never again will you be capable of love, or friendship, or joy of living, or laughter, or curiosity, or courage, or integrity. You will be hollow. We shall squeeze you empty, and then we shall fill you with ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. … The object of power is power.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The real power, the power we have to fight for night and day, is not power over things, but over men.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It will be a world of terror as much as a world of triumph. … Goldstein and his heresies will live for ever.</p>
